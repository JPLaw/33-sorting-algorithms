===
* Write three test assertions for each sorting algorithm 
 
## Sorting Algorithms
Add your Travis badge to the top of your README (even if your build is failing), and include the following information for each algorithm:
  * The name of your sorting algorithm
  * The Big Oh space and run time complexity of your algorithm
  * Whether the algorithm is stable or unstable
  * A good use case for when this is the preferred algorithm to use over others, if applicable
  * Links to sources you used to research the algorithms

### Bubble Sort 

Bubble sort is a stable algorithm and works best with small, almost sorted elements to begin with. It would not be ideal with a huge assortment of elements.

Big O time: O(n) --> n = number of items in array
Big O space: 
Notes: 
Not the most preferred method of Bubblesort- this is one I interpreted the best, and therefore was easier for me to write. There are versions with a swap method included, and with more research, I think I could refactor this.

### Merge Sort
 Merge Sort is a stable alogorithm. It starts by dividing the unsorted list into sublists. Then it divides the list into lists that each only contain one element (one element is considered sorted). THen the sorted are repeatedly merged to produce new sublists, and do so until there is only 1 list remaining- that is the new sorted list.

Big O space:
